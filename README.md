## Overview
This project is going to  use a data set with information on 21,596 homes. Our goal with this data is to find correlating factors with the price of a home so we can make recommendations to a real-estate company based on our findings. Specifically looking for factors that contribute a large amount to the variation of the price of a home so we can make business recommendations based on those factors.

## Business Problem
Our stakeholder is a real-estate company who are looking to expand to King County, Seattle starting from 2016. They need a reliable metric for house prices and would like to know which features of houses are more impactful on the price. Our task is to provide them with a linear regression model that will provide them with an equation which will include features that are most important in determining housing prices.

## Data Preparation
Our target that we're modeling for is the price of a home. In order to prep the data for modeling we split our data into two sets, a training set and a testing set. We also made sure to get rid of any NA's in the data set. A few of our pieces of data were categorical data. We took each of the possible categories and created their own columns in the data set. For example, the properties had a rating score ranging from 3 - 13. In order to better interpret this information we split each outcome into its own column with a true or false result. This made the data far easier to work with and obtain information from. 

## Modeling
The Model took five factors in total by the end, Square Footage, Latitude, Grade of "Better", Grade of "Very Good", and, The View. We chose these factors based on their correlation with our target facter, the property price. We made sure to check colinearity on all the factors and even through some factors out of the model based on their high collinearity with Square Footage. The final Function of our model came out to be Y(i) = -3.185e+07 + sqft_living165.589 + lat6.678e+05 + Grade_Better1.207e+05 +Grade_VGood2.437e+05 + View_NONE(-2.059e+05). Our R^2 Value was 0.586, meaning that with our model we are able to explain 58.6% of the variation in a home's price. Our mean squared error for our model was also significantly smaller than our baseline model and significantly smaller than our one factor model. Each variable in the model also has a significant P value, our Alpha level was 95% 

## Evaluation
We found statistically significant factors with clear and understandable coefficients. This lets us take a lot of valuable information from our model. Four of our variables where positive; Square Footage, Grade of "Better", Grade of "Very Good", and Latitude. Each of these can tell us different things. Square footing is positive with a coefficient of 165.589. This lets us know that for every square foot a property size goes up, the price of the property goes up about 165 dollars. The Grade variables each have much larger positive coefficients. 121,000 and 244,000 for "Better" and "Very Good" respectively. These tell us that if a home gets one of those ratings, on average 121,000 or 244,000 dollars of the price is thanks to that price. Lastly, the Latitude has a positive variable of 97,000. This told us that generally throughout the county, as the Latitude increased so did the price. On top of all these positive variables we also had one negative one. The "No view" variable had a negative variable of -206,000 dollars. We learned from this variable that if your property is lacking a nice view it's affecting your property value significantly.

## Conclusions
We have found quite a bit of significant information about the King County housing market through this model. A large amount of the information is applicable in the real world. For example, according to our model if you owned a property with something that obscures a nice view, it'd be worth your time and money to remove that obstruction if you can because the resulting impact would be a significant positive result on the value of your property. Another example is with the grade examples. If you're looking to invest in a property, our model tells you that it would be worth your money to invest money into a slightly lower grade property and invest some money on getting its grade up to "Better" or "Very Good" as getting your property grade up to one of our chosen grades your properties value will increase by a significant positive result. A third thing we can learn from our model is to keep in mind where we're investing. Our latitude variable told us that the northern parts of the county tend to be more expensive than the southern parts. So if you don't have as much money to spend on a home or property it would be smarter to shop on the southern end of the county. Our model turned out to be very good. We got a significant R Squared Value of 0.586, each of our variables are significant of our alpha level of 0.05, with clear and readable coefficients for each variable. There are many business recommendations you could make from this model. There are some ways we could improve our model. We could run a similar model with a larger data set for more accurate results, but we could also run a similar model with different variables that we didn't have information on.
