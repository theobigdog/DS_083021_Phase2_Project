## Overview
Our project is going to  use a data set with information on 21,596 homes. Our goal with this data is to find correlating factors with the price of a home so we can make reccomendations to a real-estate company based on our findings. Specificly looking for factors that contribute a large amount to the variation of the price of a home so we can make buisness recomendations based on those factors.

## Buisness Problem
Our stakeholder is a real-estate company who are looking to expand to King County, Seattle starting from 2016. They need a reliable prediction metric for house prices and would like to know which features of houses are more important. Our task is to provide them with a linear regression model that will provide them with an equation which will include features that are most important in determining housing prices.

## Data Preparation
Our target that we're modeling for is the price of a home. In order to prep the data for modeling we split our data into two sets, a training set and a testing set. We also made sure to get rid of any NA's in the data set. A few of our pieces of data where catagorical data. We took each of the possible catagories and created their own colomns in the data set. For example, the properties had a rating score ranging from 3 - 13. In order to better interpret this information we split each outcome into its own colomn with a true or false result. This made the data far easier to work with and obtain information from.
